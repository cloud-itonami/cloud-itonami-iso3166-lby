  "Per-jurisdiction market-entry regulatory catalog -- the G2-style
  spec-basis table the Market-Entry Compliance Governor checks every
  `:jurisdiction/assess` proposal against ('did the advisor cite an
  OFFICIAL public source for this jurisdiction's requirements, or did it
  invent one?').

  Libya's (LBY) real market-entry surface, WebFetch/curl-verified
  2026-07-22/23, is genuinely thin and institutionally uncertain -- this
  iteration specifically investigated, rather than assumed, the task
  brief's own leads (Libyan Investment Authority / a 'Privatisation and
  Investment Board' or 'General Authority of Investment and Ownership of
  Public Companies', Law No. 9 of 2010, a Companies Registry under the
  Ministry of Economy/Commerce, a Labour Law citation, and whether the
  National Oil Corporation has any independently-citable general
  market-entry mechanism) and reports exactly what could and could not be
  independently confirmed, honestly, rather than forcing a fabricated
  comprehensive picture. Same discipline Equatorial Guinea's/Eritrea's/
  Guinea-Bissau's sibling iterations in this fleet established.

  Sources actually fetched and read this session (not paraphrased from
  training-data memory):

  - **Libyan Investment Authority (LIA)**: `lia.ly` is real and live
    (WebFetch-verified). Its own homepage states its mission as
    'Investment to ensure a bright future for coming Libyan generations'
    and describes a ~$80 billion portfolio of overseas subsidiaries and
    real estate. This iteration confirms the LIA is Libya's SOVEREIGN
    WEALTH FUND (managing Libya's own oil-revenue assets ABROAD, most of
    it frozen under UN Security Council sanctions since 2011) -- its
    homepage makes NO mention of authorizing or promoting foreign private
    investment INTO Libya. This is an honest, DIFFERENT finding from the
    task brief's own plausible-starting-point hypothesis, not conflated
    with an investment-promotion agency despite the superficially similar
    name.
  - **Law No. 9 of 2010 on Investment Promotion**: independently fetched
    and read IN FULL this session via UNCTAD's own Investment Laws
    Navigator (`investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-laws/laws/193/
    libya-law-on-investment-promotion`, WebFetch/curl-verified raw HTML,
    full 31-article text). Own text confirms: issued by the General
    People's Congress (pre-2011 era), full title 'Law on Investment
    Promotion No. 9, 2010'; Art. 2 applies it to 'national, foreign, or
    joint venture capital'; Art. 5 requires 'An appropriate administrative
    authority shall be set up to execute the provisions of this Law; a
    designation and organizing decision, thereof, shall be made by the
    General People's Committee'; Art. 9 makes that same administrative
    authority 'solely concerned with the issuance of all licenses and
    necessary approvals for the investment project'; Art. 27 (own text,
    verbatim): 'The provision of this Law shall not apply on national and
    foreign capitals invested or will be invested in oil and gas
    projects.'
  - **HONEST CAVEAT, explicitly flagged rather than glossed over**: Art.
    5's own text designates the administering body by a FUTURE decision
    of 'the General People's Committee' -- a Gaddafi-era state organ that
    itself no longer exists post-2011. This iteration could NOT
    independently confirm, from any primary source fetched this session,
    which currently-operating body (if any) now exercises this Art. 5
    role, nor whether the law itself has been formally amended or
    superseded by any post-2011 legislative authority, given Libya's
    divided governance since 2014 (rival administrations in Tripoli and
    the east). The task brief's own hypothesis of a 'Privatisation and
    Investment Board' ('PIB') or a 'General Authority of Investment and
    Ownership of Public Companies' could NOT be confirmed this session --
    `pib.gov.ly` and `pib.ly` both failed DNS resolution, and no working
    search engine was available this session (WebSearch budget
    exhausted, the same constraint the GNQ sibling iteration disclosed)
    to locate an alternate domain or a news source naming the current
    administering body. Neither name is asserted as fact here; this
    catalog cites Law No. 9/2010 itself (a real, fully-read primary
    text) as the legal basis, and separately cites the Ministry of
    Economy and Trade (confirmed live and operating, see below) as the
    body that ACTUALLY administers company/business registration and
    foreign-company market entry today, without asserting these two are
    the same institution.
  - **Companies/business registration -- Ministry of Economy and Trade**:
    `economy.gov.ly` is real and live (WebFetch/curl-verified, official
    name 'وزارة الاقتصاد والتجارة' / Ministry of Economy and Trade). Its own
    homepage links a live Commercial Registry subdomain (`cr.economy.gov.ly`,
    labelled 'السجل التجاري') and dedicated 'خدمات الشركات' (Company
    Services) pages for: opening a foreign company representative office
    (`economy.gov.ly/foreign-company-office/`), foreign company branches,
    a foreign-companies operating license, commercial agencies and joint
    venture companies. This iteration independently cross-confirmed the
    Ministry of Economy's Commercial Registry role via the World Bank's
    OWN Doing Business 2020 Libya Economy Profile (PDF, independently
    fetched and read IN FULL this session via `archive.doingbusiness.org`,
    both as raw PDF and via `pdftotext`): its 'Starting a Business -
    Libya' procedure detail names, verbatim, 'Agency: Company registry at
    the Ministry of Economy' for BOTH the company-name-reservation step
    (Procedure 1) and the commercial-registry-registration step
    (Procedure 5).
  - **Foreign company representative office -- minimum bank-balance
    requirement, grounding this vertical's flagship governor check** (see
    `marketentry.governor`/`marketentry.registry`): the Ministry of
    Economy and Trade's own live registration-requirements page for
    opening a foreign company representative office in Libya
    (`economy.gov.ly/foreign-company-office/`, WebFetch/curl-verified raw
    HTML this session) states, in its own Arabic text (verbatim, item 5
    of the required-documents list): 'فتح حساب بالدينار الليبي أو النقد
    الاجنبي لدى أحد المصارف العاملة في ليبيا، وتغطية رصيده بحوالات من
    الشركة التي يمثلها بحيث يظل كافيا لتغطية الحد الادنى لمصاريف تأسيسه
    ونفقاته التجارية، وفي كل الأحوال يجب أن لا يقل الرصيد بالحساب عن
    (150,000 د.ل) مائة وخمسين ألف دينار ليبي' -- this iteration's own
    translation: 'Open an account in Libyan dinars or foreign currency
    with one of the banks operating in Libya, and cover its balance
    through transfers from the company it represents, such that it
    remains sufficient to cover the minimum costs of establishment and
    its commercial expenses; in all cases, the account balance must not
    be less than (150,000 LD) one hundred fifty thousand Libyan dinars.'
    The numeral and the spelled-out Arabic words agree here (internally
    consistent), unlike the branch figure below.
  - **HONEST, EXPLICITLY-FLAGGED DISCREPANCY, deliberately NOT resolved by
    guessing**: the same Ministry's linked foreign-company-BRANCH
    (`فرع`) registration-requirements page (also fetched/read raw HTML
    this session) states a required allocated establishment amount of
    'لا يقل عن (250.000 د.ل) مائة وخمسون ألف دينار ليبي' -- the NUMERAL
    reads 250,000 but the spelled-out Arabic words read 'one hundred
    fifty thousand' (150,000), an internal inconsistency in the source
    document itself. A second bullet on the same page independently
    states a bank-transfer confirmation of '(250.000) دينار ليبي' (pure
    numeral, 250,000, no spelled-out text to contradict it). This
    iteration does NOT construct a second governor check or catalog entry
    from this ambiguous branch figure -- it is disclosed here as an
    unreconciled source-level inconsistency, not silently resolved by
    picking whichever number looks more convenient. Only the
    representative-office figure (internally consistent, 150,000 LYD) is
    used as this catalog's `:office-balance-floor-lyd`.
  - **Foreign companies operating license**
    (`رخصة الشركات الاجنبية`): the Ministry's own linked page (fetched/
    read raw HTML) lists follow-on documentary requirements (a recent
    Commercial Registry extract, a tax-clearance certificate, a lease
    contract) for the office/branch to obtain an operating license after
    the initial permission decision -- no additional monetary figure is
    named there.
  - **This iteration specifically investigated, rather than assumed,
    whether Libya is an OHADA member state** (the supranational
    company-law route GNQ/CAF/COG's sibling catalogs use) -- independently
    checked directly on OHADA's own 'Les Etats membres de l'OHADA' page
    (`ohada.org/les-etats-membres-de-lohada/`, WebFetch/curl-verified):
    Libya is NOT listed among OHADA's member states (no 'Libye'/'Libya'
    match found). Libya's company law is therefore purely NATIONAL, not
    supranationally harmonized -- Law No. 9/2010's own preamble lists a
    pre-existing 'Commercial Law and amendments' as one of the
    instruments it builds on, but this iteration could NOT independently
    fetch that Commercial Law's own primary text/number this session (an
    honest additional gap, not filled with a guessed law number -- see
    `statute.facts`).
  - **National Oil Corporation (NOC)**: `noc.ly` is real and live
    (WebFetch/curl-verified). Its own 'الشراكات' (Partnerships) page
    describes NOC, in its own words, as 'الكيان الحكومي الوحيد الذي يشرف
    على أنشطة النفط والغاز' (the sole government entity supervising oil
    and gas activities), operating through joint ventures and Production
    Sharing Agreements with named international majors (Eni, TotalEnergies,
    Wintershall Dea, Repsol, Honeywell). This iteration specifically
    checked, per the task brief's own suggestion, whether NOC has any
    independently-citable GENERAL market-entry mechanism for a non-oil
    investor -- it does NOT: the site describes bespoke, negotiated
    partnerships with existing majors, not an 'apply through this portal'
    registration mechanism, and Law No. 9/2010's OWN Art. 27 (see above)
    explicitly excludes oil-and-gas capital from the general
    investment-promotion law's scope. Consistent with the task brief's
    own expectation, NO NOC-specific governor check is added -- honestly
    confirmed absent, not silently skipped.
  - **World Bank Doing Business 2020's own documented Libya 'Starting a
    Business' figures** (own text, standardized Private Limited Company,
    Tripoli): 'Paid-in minimum capital requirement: LYD 3,000' -- this is
    a DIFFERENT figure for a DIFFERENT instrument (a domestic
    standardized small/medium LLC formed by 5 local national owners, not
    a foreign company's market-entry channel) and is NOT conflated with
    the `:office-balance-floor-lyd` flagship figure above. Its own
    10-procedure detail additionally confirms real registration
    touchpoints used in `:required-evidence` below: Procedure 4 ('Office
    of Tax Department at the Ministry of Economy', stamp duty), Procedure
    6 ('Chamber of Commerce'), Procedure 8 ('Notarize the company lease
    and Register with the Social Security Fund - Ministry of Labor'),
    Procedure 9 ('Office of Operations license of the Ministry of
    Economy', the business operating license). This iteration did NOT
    find a distinct tax-IDENTIFICATION-NUMBER-issuance step analogous to
    GNQ's (grep of the full PDF text found no 'tax identification'/'TIN'/
    'fiscal number' mention for Libya) -- so, unlike GNQ, this catalog
    does NOT add a tax-id-verification governor check; a smaller, honest
    catalog beats forcing in a check shape that isn't actually
    documented for this jurisdiction.

  Coverage is reported HONESTLY (see `coverage`): a jurisdiction not in
  this table has NO spec-basis, full stop -- the advisor must not
  fabricate one, and the governor holds if it tries.")
